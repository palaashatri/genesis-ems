# Requirements
<!-- ## Introduction
* Knowing the units of measurement that correspond with a number can give you so much more information than a digit as a standalone.
* In a nutshell, the unit of measurement in science and math serves as the supporting pillar upon which a number rests.
* Unit conversion is a process that involves multiplication or division by a numerical factor.
* With the global flow of information that occurs these days, it is very important for everyone to learn these most basic conversion factors.
* Keeping in mind all the conversion and interconversion processes may not be easy for everyone.

## Research
* During the French Revolution, the then-existing measurement system was so impractical for trade and scientific purposes.
* So, it set the stage for the emergence of a system of measurement with rationally related units and simple rules for combining them.
* Thus, a decimal-based conversion system, called the Metric System, was introduced and it was widely accepted by scientists of those days for being a rational system.
* The metric system was devised with an aim “for all people, for all time.”
* Today, the official system of measurement in most of the countries across the world is the metric system also known as the “International System of Units.
* Through a standard system, there are many units within the metric systems and inter-conversion is tedious because one has to remember all the conversion factors.
* Hence a tool that makes all these conversions immediately available will be a welcoming choice.

## Cost and Features
* Proper unit conversion can allow for huge savings in most scenarios, particularly where high precision is required.
* This unit conversion software is free-of-cost and open-source.
* This software is also platform independent, and requires just a simple Python installation to work where it is required.
* The various features/options for interconversion of the system are:
    * Data storage
    * Length
    * Area
    * Volume
    * Mass
    * Speed
    * Pressure 
    * Power etc.
## SWOT Analysis
![SWOT Diagram](swot.png)

## 4W's and 1H
### Who
The tool is a helping hand for young children who would like to counter verify their conversions and also for scientific researchers and mathematicians.
### What
A metric conversion calculator that does metric conversions in a few seconds.
### When
When people are struggling with simple conversions or when kids would like to cross verify their answers while practicing or when people need conversion results in a jiffy to proceed on further with their calculations.
### Where
Can be put to use where simple or advanced scientific and mathematical calculations requiring conversions are involved.
### How
The system opens up to the standard list of metric conversions that are available. Upon selection of one the standard system, the list of inter-conversions i.e., the sub-system is shown on the screen. The user can now choose one subunit that needs to be converted into one or more other subunits that are available on the list. The results for all these conversions are flashed in a second.


 ### Ageing Factor
 * The earliest known uniform systems of measurement seem to have all been created sometime in the 4th and 3rd millennia BC among the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus Valley, and perhaps also Elam in Persia as well.
 * In the Magna Carta of 1215 (The Great Charter) with the seal of King John, put before him by the Barons of England, King John agreed in Clause 35 "There shall be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm, and one measure of ale and one measure of corn—namely, the London quart;—and one width of dyed and russet and hauberk cloths—namely, two ells below the selvage..."
 * Convert Weight/Mass units, such as Microgram, Milligram, Kilogram, Pound, Ounce, Gram, etc.
 * Convert Length/Distance units, such as Millimeter, Centimeter, Meter, Kilometer, Mile, Yard, etc.
 * Convert Area units, such as Square Meter, Square Kilometer, Square Mile, Square Yard, Square Foot, Square Inch, etc.
 * Convert Temperature units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin.
