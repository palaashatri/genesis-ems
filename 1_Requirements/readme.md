# Requirements

## Introduction

This project aims at developing an Empolyee Management System which can keep track of all the employees in an organisation.It is a platform where employee can store,edit,update their details and also can regularise their attendance.Their attendance will be monitored regularly by the admin.

## Research

In olden days,Employee management system in the organization used the ordinary classical methods which are merely based on pen-paper to record the data of their employees.Large number of registers had to be maintained which took more time and effort.It was a tedious process.And then the techniques evolved such as facial recognition,biometric scan and card punching etc.This again is a costly process and requires regular maintenance.The introduction of Web Applications solved all these isssues and also made it easier to manage employees which is cheaper and saves a lot of time and effort too.

## Cost and Features


In the cost estimation of the project, software cost comprises a small percentage of overall computer-based
system cost. There are different factors which are considered that can affect the ultimate cost of the software such as human, technical, hardware & software availability etc.

The important point is considered during the cost estimation of the project is its sizing. Instead of complete software size , function point and approximate lines of code are also used to size each element of the software and their costing.

We have basically estimated our project mainly on two bases:

### Effort Estimation

This refers to thetotal man hours required for the development of the project. It includes time
required for documentation also.

### Hardware Required Estimation

This includes cost of the PCs and hardware cost required for development of the project.

### Features of Project

·User Secured Login

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths
Employee management systems are useful for running a smooth organisation, especially organisations of scale. 
Admin/Manager/HR personnel can keep track of employee information, attendance records and more.
### Weakness
Employee management systems are costly, requiring lot of administrative work, patience and time. If the employee management system is down or causing some errors, it hugely impacts the Human resources and finance department. 
### Oppurtunities
Voice assist and virtual assistant can be incorporated to give a better user experience.
Biometric scan and facial reconisation can also provide a seamless and hassle free experience.
### Threats
SQL injection attack.
Cross origin resources sharing.
Unnecessary increase of deployment binary size with unused dependencies.





## 4W's and 1H
