## Introduction

This project aims at developing an Employee Management System which can keep track of all the employees in an organisation. It is a platform where employee can store,edit,update their details and also can regularise their attendance. Their attendance will be monitored regularly by the admin.

## Research

In olden days,Employee management system in the organization used the ordinary classical methods which were merely based on pen-paper to record the data of their employees. Large number of registers had to be maintained which took more time and effort. It was a tedious process. And then the techniques evolved such as facial recognition,biometric scan and card punching etc. This again is a costly process and requires regular maintenance. The introduction of Web Applications solved all these isssues and also made it easier to manage employees which is cheaper and saves a lot of time and effort too.

## Cost and Features


In the cost estimation of the project, software cost comprises a small percentage of overall computer-based
system cost. There are different factors which are considered that can affect the ultimate cost of the software such as human, technical, hardware & software availability etc.

The important point is considered during the cost estimation of the project is its sizing. Instead of complete software size , function point and approximate lines of code are also used to size each element of the software and their costing.

We have basically estimated our project mainly on two bases:

### Effort Estimation

This refers to thetotal man hours required for the development of the project. It includes time
required for documentation also.

### Hardware Required Estimation

This includes cost of the PCs and hardware cost required for development of the project.

### Features of Project

- User Secured Login

- Update Employee Details

- List Employee Details

- Update Employee Attendance

- New Employee Registration

- List All Employees

- Delete Employee

- List Employees from Departments

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths
- Employee management systems are useful for running a smooth organisation, especially organisations of scale. 
- Admin/Manager/HR personnel can keep track of employee information, attendance records and more.
### Weakness
- Employee management systems are costly, requiring lot of administrative work, patience and time. 
- If the employee management system is down or causing some errors, it hugely impacts the Human resources and finance department. 
### Oppurtunities
- Voice assist and virtual assistant can be incorporated to give a better user experience.
- Biometric scan and facial reconisation can also provide a seamless and hassle free experience.
### Threats
- SQL injection attack.
- Unknown vulnerabilities in Spring MVC/Boot packages
- Unnecessary increase of deployment binary size with unused dependencies.





## 4W's and 1H

### Who 
Employee management systems(EMS) are used in organisation where employee details and work hours are required for calculating salaries. 
Startups and large scale organisations have their own employee management systems.

### What
Employee management system(EMS) tracks employee's working hours, records their personal information and gives them option to upload their picture in the portal.

### When
When a employee gets onboarded in a company, they will be given acess to EMS to track thier attendance.


### Where
EMS will be used in corporate sector where work hours are required to calculate salary/pay.

### How
Employees will register themselves in the portal and then update their personal details. Daily they have to mark their attendance for in and out time.

### Ageing Factor
